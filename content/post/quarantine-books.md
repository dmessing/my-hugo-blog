* [The Hard Thing about Hard Things](https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205) -- I re-read bits and pieces of this.  Still one of my favorite all time books.  Easy to read and funny, with great lessons learned.  With the current COVID-19 situation, [this essay](https://a16z.com/2011/04/14/peacetime-ceowartime-ceo-2/) stood out to me, if you want a sampling of what one of his essays is like.

## Business Blogs
* [The “Jobs to be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://hbr.org/podcast/2016/12/the-jobs-to-be-done-theory-of-innovation) HBR Ideacast with Clayton Christensen
* [Platform strategy, explained](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/platform-strategy-explained) -- is from 2017 but still a great overview.

## Fun Books

* [Beastie Boys Book](https://www.amazon.com/Beastie-Boys-Book-audiobook/dp/B07D4NQNT8) first of all I *LOVE* audiobooks and this is one of the better audiobooks I have listened too.  It is innovative fun and easy to listen too.  I love all the different voice actors involved and the way they tell the story.  I enjoy the Beastie Boys but was never a *big* fan but it definitely brought back memories.  I also always love hearing passionate people talk about topcis they are extremely interested in.
