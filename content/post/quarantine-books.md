We have all had a lot of time to at home during quarantine.  It has given me a chance to read more and listen to audiobooks.  These are the best one's I've been reading.

## Fun Books

* [Beastie Boys Book](https://www.amazon.com/Beastie-Boys-Book-audiobook/dp/B07D4NQNT8) first of all I *LOVE* audiobooks and this is one of the better audiobooks I have listened too.  It is innovative fun and easy to listen too.  I love all the different voice actors involved and the way they tell the story.  I enjoy the Beastie Boys but was never a *big* fan but it definitely brought back memories.  I also always love hearing passionate people talk about topcis they are extremely interested in.
